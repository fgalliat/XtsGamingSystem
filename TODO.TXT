 The signals of the USB port A are wired to the microUSB connector so it is possible to use them only when the microUSB port is not used or not plugged on a PC. 
 The signals of the USB port B are wired to the WiFi port so it is possible to use them only when the WiFi adapter is not plugged on Arietta.

[How to read the Arietta on-board button]
 Export the GPIO line 81 by typing:
 # echo "81" > /sys/class/gpio/export

 Read the actual button state:
 # cat /sys/class/gpio/pioC17/value
 1

 Now try to press the button and type again:
 # cat /sys/class/gpio/pioC17/value
 0
